This is a small section of a larger app I intend to create for personal practice and growth in my abilities.

This is specifically the logic of calculating ALBERTA weekly wages/overtime based upon laws.

I intend to do this with every province/territory/federal and add them into a larger central project.

It's not hard to do the other provinces as they only slightly differ. (copy and paste is my best friend!)
